# Frontend Template with Next.js & Tailwind CSS

This project is a static frontend template developed using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The design is based on a live website that I first recreated directly into code, building the frontend from scratch. After completing the web version, I converted the design into a Figma layout. The focus is purely on visual structure and styling, without interactive functionality.

### Features

- Next.js used for page structure and optimized rendering.
- Tailwind CSS applied for efficient and modern styling.
- Web design originally developed first, then converted to Figma.

### Technologies Used

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Figma
